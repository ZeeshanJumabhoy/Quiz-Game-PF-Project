# PF-Project-Semester-1
  This code is a simple quiz game implemented in C. It consists of two rounds: a qualifying round and a final round. In the qualifying round, the player must answer a set of multiple-choice questions, and to proceed to the final round, they need to achieve a passing score. The final round involves a series of questions with increasing reward amounts for correct answers. The player can choose to withdraw their winnings at any point or continue playing for a chance to win more money. The game utilizes basic C programming concepts, including conditional statements and loops, and it also incorporates functions for displaying records and providing help.
